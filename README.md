# Am I The AIhole

Project to finetune a LLM on AITA posts so that they can be

1. autogenerated entirely from a title
2. autoclassified from a title + body

## Scripts

The `scripts` process data from the r/AITA dumps (submissions, comments) from <https://the-eye.eu/redarcs/>.

Stage 0 scripts take a sample from the raw dumps for experimentation.

Stage 1 scripts can take a Stage 0 sample or the raw dumps. Their job is to extract all relevant submissions and comments and discard all irrelevant data.

Stage 2 scripts take the result of Stage 1 scripts and extract any metadata required for later.
